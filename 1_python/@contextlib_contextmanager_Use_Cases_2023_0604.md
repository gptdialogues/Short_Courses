Please give me good use cases of @contextlib.contextmanager in Python3.

The `@contextlib.contextmanager` decorator in Python is an important tool to manage resources efficiently, in a clean, pythonic way. It allows you to create your own context managers.

Here are some good use cases for this decorator:

1. **File Handling**

    Files need to be closed after they're opened and used. This is a perfect use case for a context manager because you want to make sure that the file gets closed even if an error occurs while processing the file.

    ```python
    from contextlib import contextmanager

    @contextmanager
    def open_file(name):
        try:
            f = open(name, 'r')
            yield f
        finally:
            f.close()

    with open_file('test.txt') as f:
        print(f.read())
    ```

2. **Database Connections**

    Managing database connections, where you need to close the connection after performing the operations. 

    ```python
    from contextlib import contextmanager
    import sqlite3

    @contextmanager
    def db_connect(host):
        conn = sqlite3.connect(host)
        try:
            yield conn
        finally:
            conn.close()

    with db_connect('test.db') as conn:
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM users')
        print(cursor.fetchall())
    ```

3. **Lock Management**

    For multi-threaded applications where multiple threads might want to change a global variable at the same time. Using a context manager can be a good way to manage locks.

    ```python
    from contextlib import contextmanager
    import threading

    lock = threading.Lock()

    @contextmanager
    def acquire_lock(lock):
        lock.acquire()
        try:
            yield
        finally:
            lock.release()

    with acquire_lock(lock):
        # critical section of code
    ```

4. **Timing Operations**

    Context managers can be used to measure the execution time of the block of code.

    ```python
    from contextlib import contextmanager
    import time

    @contextmanager
    def timer():
        start = time.time()
        try:
            yield
        finally:
            end = time.time()
            print(f'Time elapsed: {end - start}')

    with timer():
        # code block you want to measure the execution time for
    ```

5. **Temporary Changes**

    If you want to temporarily change something and then automatically revert it, this can be a good use case for a context manager.

    ```python
    from contextlib import contextmanager

    @contextmanager
    def temporary_change(lst):
        original = list(lst)
        try:
            yield lst
        finally:
            lst[:] = original

    data = [1, 2, 3]
    with temporary_change(data) as working_data:
        working_data.append(4)
        print(f'Inside block: {working_data}')  # Inside block: [1, 2, 3, 4]

    print(f'After block: {data}')  # After block: [1, 2, 3]
    ```

Remember, a context manager ensures that resources are efficiently used, and clean-up or finalization code is executed, regardless of whether the block of code is exited via an exception or the normal execution flow.

Please give me other use cases including "Temporary Change Directory".

Sure, here are a couple of other use cases including the "Temporary Change Directory" one:

1. **Temporary Change Directory**

    If you want to temporarily change to a different directory and then return to the original directory, a context manager is very useful.

    ```python
    from contextlib import contextmanager
    import os

    @contextmanager
    def change_directory(destination):
        try:
            cwd = os.getcwd()
            os.chdir(destination)
            yield
        finally:
            os.chdir(cwd)

    with change_directory('/tmp'):
        # We are in '/tmp' directory here
        print(os.listdir())  # print files in '/tmp'
    # We are back to the original directory here
    ```

2. **Temporary Environment Variable**

    Similar to changing directories, context managers can also be used to temporarily change environment variables.

    ```python
    from contextlib import contextmanager
    import os

    @contextmanager
    def change_env(key, value):
        original = os.environ.get(key)
        os.environ[key] = value
        try:
            yield
        finally:
            if original is None:
                del os.environ[key]
            else:
                os.environ[key] = original

    with change_env('ENV_VAR', 'temporary_value'):
        # Environment variable changed
        print(os.getenv('ENV_VAR'))  # Output: 'temporary_value'
    # Environment variable restored
    print(os.getenv('ENV_VAR'))  # Output: original value or None if not previously set
    ```

3. **Capture Standard Output**

    If you want to capture the output of a function that prints to the console, you can use a context manager to redirect stdout temporarily to a string buffer.

    ```python
    from contextlib import contextmanager
    import sys
    from io import StringIO

    @contextmanager
    def capture_stdout():
        new_out = StringIO()
        old_out = sys.stdout
        sys.stdout = new_out
        try:
            yield new_out
        finally:
            sys.stdout = old_out

    with capture_stdout() as new_out:
        print("Hello, World!")
        
    # Prints: "Hello, World!\n"
    print("Captured:", new_out.getvalue())
    ```

These examples illustrate the power of the `@contextlib.contextmanager` decorator in Python for managing resources and state in a clean, efficient, and reliable way.
