Please give me good use cases for "defaultdict" of python3.

`collections.defaultdict` is a Python dictionary class that provides a default value for the key that does not exist. The defaultdict is a subclass of the built-in dict class. It overrides one method and adds one writable instance variable. The remaining functionality is the same as for the dict class.

Here are some typical use cases for `defaultdict`:

1. **Word Frequency Counter:**

    If you need to count the frequency of elements in a list, tuple, or string, defaultdict is a good choice.

    ```python
    from collections import defaultdict

    word_freq = defaultdict(int)
    text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
    for word in text.split():
        word_freq[word] += 1
    print(word_freq)
    ```
   
    This will count the frequency of each word in the string and store it in the dictionary `word_freq`.

2. **Graph Representation:**

    defaultdict can be used for representing a graph where keys represent nodes and values represent edges.

    ```python
    from collections import defaultdict

    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = [('A', 'B'), ('A', 'C'), ('B', 'D'), ('C', 'D')]
    for edge in edges:
        a, b = edge
        graph[a].append(b)
    print(graph)
    ```

    Here the graph is represented as an adjacency list.

3. **Grouping Items:**

    You can use defaultdict to group items in a collection.

    ```python
    from collections import defaultdict

    s = [('yellow', 1), ('blue', 2), ('yellow', 3), ('blue', 4), ('red', 1)]
    d = defaultdict(list)
    for k, v in s:
        d[k].append(v)
    print(d)
    ```

    This will group elements based on their color.

4. **Building Multidict:**

    A multidict is a dictionary where its keys map to multiple values, and defaultdict is a straightforward way to build them.

    ```python
    from collections import defaultdict

    multidict = defaultdict(set)
    pairs = [("a", 1), ("a", 2), ("b", 3), ("b", 4), ("b", 1)]
    for key, value in pairs:
        multidict[key].add(value)
    print(multidict)
    ```

    This will store unique values for each key as a set. You can replace `set` with `list` if you want to include duplicate values.

5. **Providing Default Values:**

    defaultdict is very useful when you want to provide a default value for keys that don't exist in the dictionary.

    ```python
    from collections import defaultdict

    default_value_dict = defaultdict(lambda: 'Not Available')
    default_value_dict['a'] = 1
    default_value_dict['b'] = 2
    print(default_value_dict['a'])  # prints 1
    print(default_value_dict['c'])  # prints 'Not Available'
    ```

    Here the default value for any key that does not exist in the dictionary is 'Not Available'.
    
These are just a few examples, and there can be many other scenarios where defaultdict can be useful. The best use of defaultdict is when you want to avoid key errors and provide a default value for non-existent keys.
