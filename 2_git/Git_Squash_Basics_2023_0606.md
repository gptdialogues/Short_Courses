Please give me a short course to learn about advanced git commands including "git squash". In the course, please provide a series of commands for me to try by starting from creating a repository, adding example codes, and committing some modifications.

Sure, let's get started. We'll create a new repository, add some files, make changes to those files, create some branches, merge them, and then learn about the `git squash` command.

**Step 1: Create a new repository**
First, let's create a directory for our repository, initialize it, and add an initial commit.

```bash
mkdir myrepository
cd myrepository
git init
echo "# My Repository" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

**Step 2: Create some example code files and commit changes**
Now, let's create some files, add some code, and commit those changes.

```bash
echo "print('Hello, world!')" > hello.py
git add hello.py
git commit -m "Add hello.py"

echo "print('Hello again, world!')" > hello_again.py
git add hello_again.py
git commit -m "Add hello_again.py"
```

**Step 3: Make modifications and commit them**
Now, we'll make modifications to `hello.py` and commit them.

```bash
echo "print('Hello, universe!')" > hello.py
git add hello.py
git commit -m "Modify hello.py"
```

**Step 4: Create a new branch and make modifications**
We'll create a new branch, make changes there, and commit them.

```bash
git checkout -b new-feature
echo "print('Hello, multiverse!')" > hello.py
git add hello.py
git commit -m "Modify hello.py in new-feature branch"
```

**Step 5: Merge the new branch**
Now, we'll switch back to the `master` branch and merge our `new-feature` branch into it.

```bash
git checkout master
git merge new-feature
```

**Step 6: Git squash**
Now, let's talk about `git squash`. Git squash allows you to condense the history of commits into fewer, more meaningful commits. We use it in conjunction with `git rebase`.

Note: Before proceeding with the squashing operation, please be aware that it's a type of rebase and hence can modify history. It's fine to use it on commits that have been shared with others if and only if they are aware of the implications.

Let's assume we want to squash the last 3 commits.

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

This will open up an editor with a list of the last 3 commits. The commits are ordered from oldest to newest. Each line will look something like this:

```bash
pick a1b2c3d Add hello.py
pick e4f5g6h Add hello_again.py
pick i7j8k9l Modify hello.py
```

To squash the commits, you replace `pick` with `squash` or `s` next to the commits you want to squash. The first commit will be the one the others are squashed into.

```bash
pick a1b2c3d Add hello.py
squash e4f5g6h Add hello_again.py
squash i7j8k9l Modify hello.py
```

When you save and close the editor, another editor instance will open for you to change the commit message of the new squashed commit. Once you save and close that, the squash operation will be complete.

Keep in mind that squashing makes sense when you're cleaning up your local commit history before sharing your changes with others. It is a good practice to not squash commits that have already been pushed and shared with others, as this changes history, which can lead to confusion and data loss.

Please add some additional explanation for resolving conflicts in the process of “git squash.”

Sure, let's talk about resolving conflicts during the process of `git squash`. Conflicts can occur when you're squashing commits, just like when you're merging branches. If the changes made in one commit contradict with the changes made in another, Git will pause and allow you to resolve the conflicts before proceeding.

When you run into a conflict, Git will output a message similar to this:

```bash
error: could not apply fa39187... something to squash later
Resolve all conflicts manually, mark them as resolved with
"git add/rm <conflicted_files>", then run "git rebase --continue".
You can instead skip this commit: run "git rebase --skip".
To abort and get back to the state before "git rebase", run "git rebase --abort".
Could not apply fa39187f3c641e26cfaaabb764794f3979b556c7... something to squash later
```

The conflicted file will look something like this:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
<<<<<<< HEAD
print("Hello, universe!")
=======
print("Hello, multiverse!")
>>>>>>> fa39187... Modify hello.py in new-feature branch
```

The `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` lines are conflict markers. The code between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` is the code in the commit you're squashing into, and the code between `=======` and `>>>>>>> fa39187...` is the code in the commit you're trying to squash.

Your task is to manually edit the file to resolve the conflict. For instance, you might decide to keep both lines:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
print("Hello, universe!")
print("Hello, multiverse!")
```

After you've resolved the conflict, you'll need to add the file to Git to mark it as resolved:

```bash
git add hello.py
```

Once all conflicts have been resolved and marked as such, you can continue the rebase operation:

```bash
git rebase --continue
```

If at any point you want to abort the rebase and go back to the state of your repository before you began, you can use:

```bash
git rebase --abort
```

Remember, rebasing, including squashing, can modify commit history. It's a good idea to only squash commits that haven't been shared with others yet.
