Please give me a short course to learn about advanced git commands including "git rebase". In the course, please provide a series of commands for me to try by starting from creating a repository, adding example codes, and committing some modifications.

Sure, let's go through the process step by step. Git is a very powerful tool that helps manage version control. It can be complex, so we'll start with the basics, then move on to more advanced topics like `git rebase`.

**Creating a new Repository**

Firstly, we will create a new directory and initialize it as a git repository:

```bash
$ mkdir git-course
$ cd git-course
$ git init
```

**Creating and Adding Example Code**

Now, let's create some example code files:

```bash
$ echo "print('Hello, World!')" > hello.py
$ echo "print('Goodbye, World!')" > goodbye.py
```

Then, let's add these files to our Git repository:

```bash
$ git add hello.py goodbye.py
```

Next, we will commit these files to the repository:

```bash
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

**Creating and Switching Branches**

Let's create a new branch to make some modifications. 

```bash
$ git checkout -b feature
```

We will modify the `hello.py` file:

```bash
$ echo "print('Hello, Git!')" > hello.py
```

Then, we commit this change:

```bash
$ git add hello.py
$ git commit -m "Change greeting in hello.py"
```

**Merging Changes**

Now, we go back to the main branch:

```bash
$ git checkout master
```

And merge our changes from the `feature` branch:

```bash
$ git merge feature
```

This will bring the changes made in `feature` branch to `master`.

**Using git rebase**

Git rebase is a command that allows you to integrate changes from one branch into another. It's an alternative to git merge but with a cleaner history.

First, let's make a new branch and make a new commit:

```bash
$ git checkout -b feature2
$ echo "print('Another file!')" > another.py
$ git add another.py
$ git commit -m "Add another file"
```

Go back to `master` and make a change:

```bash
$ git checkout master
$ echo "print('Goodbye, Git!')" > goodbye.py
$ git add goodbye.py
$ git commit -m "Change farewell in goodbye.py"
```

Now, we have diverging changes. We can use rebase to integrate these changes. Go back to `feature2`:

```bash
$ git checkout feature2
```

Then rebase onto `master`:

```bash
$ git rebase master
```

This will replay your changes from `feature2` onto `master`. If there are any conflicts, git will pause and allow you to resolve them before continuing.

If you want to visualize your changes, you can use the `git log` command:

```bash
$ git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph
```

**Note:** Please replace `$` with the appropriate command line prompt for your system.

Git is a powerful tool with many more commands and options. This is just the start. The `git help` command is a good way to learn more. For example, `git help rebase` will provide more details about the rebase command.
